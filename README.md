Credit Card Fraud Detection – Python EDA Project
🧠 Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze credit card transactions and detect fraud patterns using Python.
We used a simulated dataset of 500 transactions that mimics real-world credit card data.
This project focuses on visual data analysis (EDA), not machine learning.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used:
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

📊 What I Did (Step-by-Step):
Loaded the dataset into Python using pandas
Checked for missing values and data types
Converted is_fraud to string for clear plots
Created the following visualizations:
   ✅ Fraud vs Non-Fraud count (red & green bars)
   ✅ Fraud by channel
   ✅ Transaction amount distribution by fraud status (boxplot)
   ✅ Top 10 risky customers (repeat frauds)

🔍 Key Insights:
Fraud is less frequent, but present in all channels
Online & Mobile channels show more fraud activity
Fraud transactions are mostly medium-range in amount
Some customers commit fraud multiple times

✅ Conclusion:
This beginner-friendly project helped me practice real-world Python data analysis
and explain fraud behavior through visuals.
